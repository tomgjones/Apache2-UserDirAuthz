Description: simple one directory per username access control
 When used as a PerlAuthzHandler with Apache+mod_perl, Apache2::UserdirAuthz
 will perform simple access control, where each user has access to the part of
 the hierarchy named after their username. For example, a user "tom" will have
 access to all locations under /tom/, such as /tom/index.html, /tom/logo.png,
 and so on.
