=head1 NAME

Apache2::UserdirAuthz - simple one directory per username access control

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    PerlSetVar userdirrealms example.org,example.com
    
    <Location />
        AuthType Kerberos     # should work with any authtype
        Require valid-user
        PerlAuthzHandler Apache2::UserdirAuthz
    </Location>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When used as a PerlAuthzHandler with Apache+mod_perl, Apache2::UserdirAuthz
will perform simple access control, where each user has access to the
part of the hierarchy named after their username.  For example, a
user "tom" will have access to all locations under C</tom/>, such as
C</tom/index.html>, C</tom/logo.png>, and so on.

If the username contains an @, the part after the @ can be conditionally
stripped off by setting C<userdirrealms> with C<PerlSetVar>.  This is
useful when using with Kerberos, where usernames are of the form
C<user@realm>.  To set realm stripping for multiple realms, separate
with commas, as demonstrated in the SYNOPSIS.

Any requests for paths outside the user's own prefix result in a 401
response (the handler returns C<Apache2::Const::HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED>).

If the username contains a slash, this is taken literally when
constructing the prefix for the (path portion of the) URI.  So, if
the username is C<host/foo.example.org@EXAMPLE.ORG>, and the
C<EXAMPLE.ORG> realm is stripped, then the user will have access
to URIs under C</host/foo.example.org/>.
